# Hi, I'm Vedika 👋  

I’m a **Product Manager at [Arcesium](https://www.arcesium.com)**, building **[Aquata](https://aquata.ai)** — a data platform that powers insights for hedge funds, investment managers, and private market clients.  

My work sits at the crossroads of **data infrastructure, AI systems, and product strategy** — helping transform complex, large-scale data into actionable intelligence. I love blending analytical depth with hands-on experimentation to bring clarity, precision, and intelligence into the products I ship.  

---

### 💼 What I Work On

- 🧠 **AI & Data PM Projects:** Designing GenAI-based workflows that turn financial data into intelligent narratives (e.g., *FinSummarizer* — a GenAI tool that converts raw financial datasets into human-like summaries).  
- ⚙️ **Platform Product Strategy:** Shaping Aquata’s evolution as a **self-serve data platform** — enabling seamless data access, enrichment, and governance for institutional clients.  
- 🤖 **AI Infrastructure Exploration:** Implementing **MCP servers** and exploring **agent-based architectures** for enterprise data discovery and automation.  
- 🧩 **PM-as-a-Builder Mindset:** Prototyping and documenting hands-on AI PM projects — from architecture flows to prompt design — to bridge concept and implementation.  

---

### 🚀 What I’m Currently Focused On

- Experimenting with **RAG**, **multi-agent frameworks**, and **AI orchestration patterns** for enterprise data applications.  
- Developing **AI PM learning systems** — templates, project scaffolds, and structured frameworks for end-to-end AI product design.

### 💡 My Product Philosophy  

> *“Great AI products emerge when human intuition meets data intelligence.”*  

I believe Product Managers should not just define outcomes — they should understand how technology achieves them.  
For me, AI Product Management means:  

- Balancing **technical curiosity** with **strategic clarity**,  
- Building with **users-in-loop**, not just models-in-loop,  
- Treating every AI prototype as a **learning system**, not a feature.

### 🌱 Outside of Work  

I’m deeply curious about how **AI abstractions evolve into usable products** — from intelligent data agents to adaptive enterprise platforms.  
You’ll often find me experimenting with new frameworks, writing PM guides, or refining AI prototypes that merge product thinking with model intelligence.
