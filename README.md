# 👋 Hi, I'm Vedika  

I’m a **Product Manager at [Arcesium](https://www.arcesium.com)**, building **[Aquata](https://aquata.ai)** — a next-generation data platform that powers insights for **hedge funds, investment managers, and private market clients**.  

My work sits at the crossroads of **data infrastructure, AI systems, and product strategy** — transforming complex datasets into intelligent, actionable products.  
I’m passionate about blending analytical depth with hands-on experimentation to bring clarity, precision, and impact into everything I build.

---

## 💼 What I Work On  

- 🧠 **AI & Data PM Projects:** Designing GenAI-based workflows that turn financial data into human-like insights.  
  → *Example:* **FinSummarizer** — a GenAI tool that converts raw financial datasets into readable summaries within seconds.  

- ⚙️ **Platform Product Strategy:** Driving Aquata’s evolution as a **self-serve data platform** that simplifies data discovery, enrichment, and governance for institutional clients.  

- 🤖 **AI Infrastructure Exploration:** Implementing **MCP servers** and exploring **agent-based architectures** to enable intelligent enterprise data access and automation.  

- 🧩 **PM-as-a-Builder Mindset:** Translating product concepts into tangible prototypes — bridging strategy and implementation through real AI builds, architecture flows, and prompt design.  

---

## 🚀 What I’m Currently Focused On  

- Experimenting with **RAG**, **multi-agent frameworks**, and **AI orchestration patterns** for enterprise data applications.  
- Building **AI PM learning systems** — reusable templates, project scaffolds, and frameworks for end-to-end AI product design.

## 💡 My Product Philosophy  

> “Great AI products emerge when human intuition meets data intelligence.”  

For me, **AI Product Management** means balancing product strategy with technical depth.  
It’s about understanding not just *what* to build — but *how* technology achieves it.  

- **Balancing** technical curiosity with strategic clarity  
- **Building** with users-in-loop, not just models-in-loop  
- **Treating** every AI prototype as a learning system, not a feature

## 🛠️ Featured Work  

Here are a few projects that reflect my hands-on journey as an **AI & Data Product Manager** — where product thinking meets practical AI development.  

| 🧩 Project | 📘 Description | 🎯 Focus Area |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| 🧾 **[FinSummarizer](https://github.com/vedika2609/ai_pm_developer_portfolio/tree/main/01-fin_summarizer)** | GenAI tool that converts financial datasets into narrative insights | Generative AI, LLM Integration |
| 🤖 **[AI Data Agent](https://github.com/vedika2609/ai_data_agent)** | AI data agent system that connects natural language to enterprise data | AI Infrastructure, Data PM |

## 🌱 Outside of Work  

I’m deeply curious about how **AI abstractions evolve into usable products** — from intelligent data agents to adaptive enterprise platforms.  
Outside of work, I experiment with frameworks, write PM guides, and refine prototypes that blend **product thinking** with **model intelligence**.  

> *“Where data platforms end, AI-driven products begin — that’s where I love to build.”*
